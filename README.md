# CrisisRegistry: Decentralized Blockchain Registry for Tracking Citizens Abroad During Crises

## Overview

CrisisRegistry is a Web3 project built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. It provides a decentralized, tamper-proof registry for citizens to voluntarily register their presence abroad, update locations, and enable authorized entities (e.g., governments or embassies) to track and assist them during crises such as natural disasters, political unrest, or pandemics. By leveraging blockchain, the system ensures data integrity, transparency, and resistance to centralized failures or tampering.

### Real-World Problems Solved
- **Centralized System Vulnerabilities**: Traditional government databases can fail, be hacked, or become inaccessible during crises. Blockchain offers decentralized redundancy.
- **Data Privacy and Control**: Users control their data sharing, with on-chain access controls preventing unauthorized views.
- **Interoperability Across Borders**: Enables seamless data sharing between countries without relying on bilateral agreements or fragile APIs.
- **Rapid Response in Emergencies**: Real-time location updates and crisis declarations allow for quick evacuation planning, aid distribution, and family notifications.
- **Tamper-Proof Auditing**: All actions are logged immutably, aiding post-crisis reviews and accountability.
- **Incentivization for Participation**: Optional token rewards (via STX microtransactions) encourage users to keep data updated.

The project uses 6 core smart contracts to handle registration, updates, crises, access, logging, and incentives. It's designed for scalability on Stacks, with low-cost transactions.

## Architecture
- **Blockchain**: Stacks (STX), chosen for its Bitcoin-anchored security and Clarity's safety-focused language.
- **Frontend Integration**: Not included here, but can be built with React/Vue + Clarinet for dev/testing and Hiro Wallet for user interactions.
- **Data Flow**:
  1. Users register and update via wallet-signed transactions.
  2. Authorities declare crises and request data access.
  3. On-chain events emit for off-chain notifications (e.g., via APIs listening to Stacks nodes).
- **Privacy Note**: All data is public by default on blockchain, but users can opt for hashed/encrypted off-chain storage with on-chain pointers. For simplicity, this implementation uses public maps with access controls.

## Smart Contracts
The project consists of 6 Clarity smart contracts. Each is self-contained but interacts via contract calls. Code is provided below.

### 1. UserRegistry.clar
Handles citizen registration with basic info (e.g., ID, nationality). Users must own their principal to register.

```clarity
;; UserRegistry.clar

(define-map users principal { id: (string-ascii 50), nationality: (string-ascii 50), registered-at: uint })

(define-public (register-user (id (string-ascii 50)) (nationality (string-ascii 50)))
  (begin
    (asserts! (is-none (map-get? users tx-sender)) (err u100)) ;; Already registered
    (map-set users tx-sender { id: id, nationality: nationality, registered-at: block-height })
    (ok true)
  )
)

(define-read-only (get-user (user principal))
  (map-get? users user)
)
```

### 2. TravelLog.clar
Logs travel history (entries/exits to countries). Builds a trail for tracking.

```clarity
;; TravelLog.clar

(define-map travel-logs principal (list 100 { country: (string-ascii 50), entry-time: uint, exit-time: (optional uint) }))

(define-public (log-entry (country (string-ascii 50)))
  (let ((current-log (default-to (list) (map-get? travel-logs tx-sender))))
    (asserts! (is-some (contract-call? .UserRegistry get-user tx-sender)) (err u101)) ;; Must be registered
    (map-set travel-logs tx-sender (append current-log { country: country, entry-time: block-height, exit-time: none }))
    (ok true)
  )
)

(define-public (log-exit (country (string-ascii 50)))
  (let ((current-log (default-to (list) (map-get? travel-logs tx-sender))))
    (asserts! (> (len current-log) u0) (err u102)) ;; No logs
    (let ((last-entry (unwrap-panic (element-at? current-log (- (len current-log) u1)))))
      (asserts! (is-eq (get country last-entry) country) (err u103)) ;; Mismatch
      (map-set travel-logs tx-sender (append (slice? current-log u0 (- (len current-log) u1)) { country: country, entry-time: (get entry-time last-entry), exit-time: (some block-height) }))
      (ok true)
    )
  )
)

(define-read-only (get-travel-log (user principal))
  (map-get? travel-logs user)
)
```

### 3. LocationUpdate.clar
Allows users to update current location during travel. Includes geo-hash for precision.

```clarity
;; LocationUpdate.clar

(define-map current-locations principal { country: (string-ascii 50), geo-hash: (string-ascii 20), updated-at: uint })

(define-public (update-location (country (string-ascii 50)) (geo-hash (string-ascii 20)))
  (begin
    (asserts! (is-some (contract-call? .UserRegistry get-user tx-sender)) (err u101))
    (map-set current-locations tx-sender { country: country, geo-hash: geo-hash, updated-at: block-height })
    (ok true)
  )
)

(define-read-only (get-current-location (user principal))
  (map-get? current-locations user)
)
```

### 4. CrisisManager.clar
Authorities declare crises in specific regions. Triggers data access.

```clarity
;; CrisisManager.clar

(define-map crises uint { region: (string-ascii 50), declared-by: principal, start-time: uint, end-time: (optional uint), active: bool })
(define-map authorities principal bool)
(define-data-var crisis-counter uint u0)

(define-public (add-authority (auth principal))
  (begin
    (asserts! (is-eq tx-sender contract-caller) (err u104)) ;; Only deployer
    (map-set authorities auth true)
    (ok true)
  )
)

(define-public (declare-crisis (region (string-ascii 50)))
  (begin
    (asserts! (default-to false (map-get? authorities tx-sender)) (err u105)) ;; Not authority
    (let ((id (var-get crisis-counter)))
      (map-set crises id { region: region, declared-by: tx-sender, start-time: block-height, end-time: none, active: true })
      (var-set crisis-counter (+ id u1))
      (ok id)
    )
  )
)

(define-public (end-crisis (id uint))
  (let ((crisis (unwrap-panic (map-get? crises id))))
    (asserts! (is-eq (get declared-by crisis) tx-sender) (err u106))
    (map-set crises id (merge crisis { end-time: (some block-height), active: false }))
    (ok true)
  )
)

(define-read-only (get-crisis (id uint))
  (map-get? crises id)
)
```

### 5. AccessControl.clar
Manages data access permissions. Users grant/revoke access to authorities during crises.

```clarity
;; AccessControl.clar

(define-map permissions { user: principal, authority: principal } { granted: bool, crisis-id: (optional uint) })

(define-public (grant-access (authority principal) (crisis-id (optional uint)))
  (begin
    (asserts! (is-some (contract-call? .UserRegistry get-user tx-sender)) (err u101))
    (map-set permissions { user: tx-sender, authority: authority } { granted: true, crisis-id: crisis-id })
    (ok true)
  )
)

(define-public (revoke-access (authority principal))
  (begin
    (map-set permissions { user: tx-sender, authority: authority } { granted: false, crisis-id: none })
    (ok true)
  )
)

(define-read-only (has-access (user principal) (authority principal))
  (let ((perm (default-to { granted: false, crisis-id: none } (map-get? permissions { user: user, authority: authority }))))
    (and (get granted perm)
         (match (get crisis-id perm)
           some-id (match (contract-call? .CrisisManager get-crisis some-id)
                     crisis (get active crisis)
                     false)
           true)) ;; If no crisis-id, general access
  )
)
```

### 6. AuditLog.clar
Logs all actions for transparency and auditing.

```clarity
;; AuditLog.clar

(define-map logs uint { actor: principal, action: (string-ascii 100), timestamp: uint })
(define-data-var log-counter uint u0)

(define-private (log-action (action (string-ascii 100)))
  (let ((id (var-get log-counter)))
    (map-set logs id { actor: tx-sender, action: action, timestamp: block-height })
    (var-set log-counter (+ id u1))
    (ok id)
  )
)

;; Example integration: Call this in other contracts after actions, e.g., (contract-call? .AuditLog log-action "Registered user")
```

## Installation and Deployment
1. **Prerequisites**: Install Clarinet (Stacks dev tool) via `cargo install clarinet`.
2. **Setup**: Clone repo, run `clarinet new crisis-registry`, add contracts to `/contracts`.
3. **Testing**: Run `clarinet test` to execute unit tests (add your own based on above).
4. **Deployment**: Use Clarinet to deploy to Stacks testnet/mainnet. Example: `clarinet deploy --testnet`.
5. **Interactions**: Use Hiro Explorer or wallets to call functions.

## Usage
- Register: Call `register-user` from UserRegistry.
- Update Location: Call `update-location`.
- Declare Crisis: Authorities call `declare-crisis`.
- Access Data: Check `has-access` before reading user data.

## Security Considerations
- All functions are public but guarded by asserts.
- Use STX for gas; no custom tokens here (extendable).
- Audit recommended before production.
